🛠️ First-Time Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to set up the application on your system for the first time:

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 or higher** (check with `python --version` or `python3 --version`)
- **pip** (usually comes with Python)
- **Git** (if cloning from repository)
- **Internet connection** (for downloading dependencies and models)

---

## Step-by-Step Installation Guide

### Step 1: Download or Clone the Project

**Option A: If you have the project folder already:**
- Navigate to the project folder in your terminal/command prompt
- Skip to Step 2

**Option B: Clone from Git (if available):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saa-nikaa/AI-Interview-Prep-Platform.git
cd AI-Interview-Prep-Platform
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

**Why?** A virtual environment isolates project dependencies and prevents conflicts with other Python projects.

**Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

This creates a `venv` folder in your project directory.

### Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```bash
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
*(If you get an execution policy error, run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`)*

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

✅ **Success indicator:** You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

### Step 4: Install Python Dependencies

Install all required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

⏱️ **Note:** This may take 5-10 minutes depending on your internet speed, especially for `torch` and `transformers` packages.

### Step 5: Install spaCy Language Model

Download the English language model for NLP features:
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

✅ **Verification:** You should see "✔ Download and installation successful" message.

### Step 6: Verify Installation (Optional but Recommended)

Test that key modules can be imported:
```bash
python -c "import streamlit; import spacy; import pandas; print('All core packages installed successfully!')"
```

### Step 7: Run the Application

Start the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

✅ **Success:** Your default web browser should automatically open with the application running at `http://localhost:8501`

If the browser doesn't open automatically, copy the URL shown in the terminal and paste it into your browser.

## First Run Checklist

After the app launches, you should see:

- ✅ ATS Resume Scanner tab
- ✅ HR & Technical Question Generator tab
- ✅ MCQ Generator tab
- ✅ Practice Mode tab
- ✅ JD Analyzer tab
- ✅ Voice Interview tab
- ✅ Resume Rewriter tab
- ✅ Analytics Dashboard tab
- ✅ PDF Export option

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Python is not recognized"
- **Solution:** Make sure Python is installed and added to your system PATH. Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Issue: "pip is not recognized"
- **Solution:** Reinstall Python and make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

### Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError" for any package
- **Solution:** Make sure your virtual environment is activated (you see `(venv)` in terminal), then run:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Issue: "spacy: command not found" or spaCy model download fails
- **Solution:** Ensure spaCy is installed first (`pip install spacy`), then retry:
  ```bash
  python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
  ```

### Issue: App runs but AI features don't work
- **Note:** AI features (LLM-based question generation) require `transformers` and `torch`. These are large packages.
- **Fallback:** The application has built-in fallback mechanisms and will use traditional question banks if AI models are unavailable.

### Issue: Port 8501 is already in use
- **Solution:** Streamlit will automatically use the next available port, or stop other Streamlit apps running on that port.


## ⚡ Quick Start (Windows)

We have included a `run.bat` script to automatically handle the environment for you.

**In Command Prompt:**
```cmd
run.bat
```

**In PowerShell:**
```powershell
.\run.bat
```

---

## Stopping the Application

- Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where Streamlit is running
- The application will shut down and you'll return to the command prompt

---

## Next Steps

1. **Upload a Resume (PDF)** - Try the ATS Resume Scanner
2. **Generate Questions** - Test the HR & Technical Question Generator
3. **Upload a Job Description** - Use the JD Analyzer to compare your resume
4. **Try Practice Mode** - Test your knowledge with timed MCQs
5. **Export PDF Report** - Generate a comprehensive report of your practice session

---

## Running the Application Again (After First Setup)

Once set up, you only need:

1. Navigate to the project folder
2. Activate virtual environment: `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows) or `source venv/bin/activate` (Mac/Linux)
3. Run: `streamlit run app.py`
